# NistPy
Python module for interfacing with NIST Webbook (a chemistry resource)

This is a Python 2.x module for interfacing with the Nist Webbook (http://webbook.nist.gov/)
It incorporates native Python tools such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib for using data in a pythonic manner
Object oriented design allows using data in ways not possible with Nist Webbook itself.

Project is still under construction, please use caution, and see source code for missing features!

# To-do:	major testing for bugs
#		some features (see source code)
#		documentation
#		migration to Python 3
